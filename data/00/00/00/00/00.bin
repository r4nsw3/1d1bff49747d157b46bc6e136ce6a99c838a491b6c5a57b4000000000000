  |   Skybolt Zack is the result of a unique way of mixing platformer       |
  |   mechanics and color matching gameplay.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Controls are tight and Zack's ability to rocket punch, dash, focus,   |
  |   change direction when destroying an enemy and more, offers more       |
  |   depth than what meets the eye - following the "easy to learn, hard    |
  |   to master" mantra.                                                    |

  |   It's a platformer where you don't jump, and a music game where you    |
  |   dictate your own rhythm. It feels like no other game!                 |
  |                                                                         |
